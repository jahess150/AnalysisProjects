# AnalysisProjects
My personal portfolio of data analysis projects. Many of the projects in this repository come from Kaggle competitions.

Each project is contained within its own named folder. Within each folder, you'll find a `data` folder containing all CSVs and other data files
used in the analysis. It will also contain a `media` folder containing any pictures used in the notebook, and a `.ipynb` notebook containing
the actual analysis. For each project, I've also included a `*_README.md` file containing the details of the project including the goal of the project 
as well the scores of my submissions.
