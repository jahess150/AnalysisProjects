This can help identify the common groups that customers fall into, and allow us to perform a customer segmentation. A **customer segmentation** is a method where a business can divide their customers into a few specific subgroups. This is helpful because a business can decide how to market differently to each one of these subgroups to maximize the business' overall profit. We will perform this segmentation using a machine learning model called *K-Means Clustering*. \n\n## How K-Means Clustering Works\n\n*K-Means Clustering* is an unsupervised model, which means it attempts to find patterns or trends within the data. It plots multiple details about a customer population, and then attempts to find \"clusters\" of customers that are similar to each other. This allows the model to identify each cluster as a subgroup of our customer population. Once we've identified our different subgroups, we can do some analysis to learn more details about each subgroup. \n\nThis project will have the following structure:\n\n1. Loading in and inspecting data.\n2. Cleaning data. (handling missing values, checking for outliers)\n3. Feature engineering.\n4. Data preprocessing for machine learning.\n5. Creating K-Means Clustering model.\n6. Compare each customer subgroup defined by our K-means model. \n\n# 1) Loading in and Inspecting Data\n\nLet's first load in our data and take a look at the given variables:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/customer-personality-analysis/marketing_campaign.csv\", sep = \"\\t\")\ndata.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-22T15:15:24.620147Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-22T15:15:24.620585Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-22T15:15:24.653825Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-22T15:15:24.620555Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-22T15:15:24.652410Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 2240 entries, 0 to 2239\nData columns (total 29 columns):\n #   Column               Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------               --------------  -----  \n 0   ID                   2240 non-null   int64  \n 1   Year_Birth           2240 non-null   int64  \n 2   Education            2240 non-null   object \n 3   Marital_Status       2240 non-null   object \n 4   Income               2216 non-null   float64\n 5   Kidhome              2240 non-null   int64  \n 6   Teenhome             2240 non-null   int64  \n 7   Dt_Customer          2240 non-null   object \n 8   Recency              2240 non-null   int64  \n 9   MntWines             2240 non-null   int64  \n 10  MntFruits            2240 non-null   int64  \n 11  MntMeatProducts      2240 non-null   int64  \n 12  MntFishProducts      2240 non-null   int64  \n 13  MntSweetProducts     2240 non-null   int64  \n 14  MntGoldProds         2240 non-null   int64  \n 15  NumDealsPurchases    2240 non-null   int64  \n 16  NumWebPurchases      2240 non-null   int64  \n 17  NumCatalogPurchases  2240 non-null   int64  \n 18  NumStorePurchases    2240 non-null   int64  \n 19  NumWebVisitsMonth    2240 non-null   int64  \n 20  AcceptedCmp3         2240 non-null   int64  \n 21  AcceptedCmp4         2240 non-null   int64  \n 22  AcceptedCmp5         2240 non-null   int64  \n 23  AcceptedCmp1         2240 non-null   int64  \n 24  AcceptedCmp2         2240 non-null   int64  \n 25  Complain             2240 non-null   int64  \n 26  Z_CostContact        2240 non-null   int64  \n 27  Z_Revenue            2240 non-null   int64  \n 28  Response             2240 non-null   int64  \ndtypes: float64(1), int64(25), object(3)\nmemory usage: 507.6+ KB\n","output_type":"stream"}]}]}
